Most of these companies are blindly sending letters and making phone calls to make an effort to retain some form of payment.

    "___\n",
    "We knew prior to starting this project that this was a difficult task to take on. We found this to be true, especially during our modeling stage due to extreme data imbalance. During our process, we exhausted our efforts in attempt to reduce imbalanced data, and still did not receive \"good\" results. We \"predicted\" this would be the case due to the nature of the dataset i.e. business. Therefore, we utilized multiple machine learning models to exploit features deemed most important, and derived a scoring sytem in order to segement and rank accounts by likehood of payments using historical successes... Which then can be used to prioritize accounts and increase efficiency. As we walk through the README, you'll notice we scrubbed and explore our data in multiple places, and not just at the begining, but the work flow will be consistent with our OSEMiN method. "
